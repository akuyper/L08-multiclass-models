## Overview

This is an **OPTIONAL** lab. Students are not required to complete it. However, attempting the lab is **strongly** recommended, especially if your final project involves predicting a categorical outcome with multiple levels. This lab provides an example workflow for multiclass problems.

## Instructions

After creating your own GitHub repository and connecting it to your RStudio, you should work through the exercises provided in `L08_baseline_models.html`. A template is also provided (rename as `lastname_firstname_L08.qmd`).
